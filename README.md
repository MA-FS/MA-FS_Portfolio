## Michael Atkins Full Stack Developer Portfolio

### **Work Completed**

> **User Story**
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

A new website was created to serve as a portfolio of work during my Full Stack Development career. As time progresses this repository will be updated to include additional works.

Initial design includes;
*   Responsive web layout to suit multiple device types
*   About Me section
*   Flex containers for deployed applications
*   Skills acquired list
*   Contact links

### **Result**

![Completed Website](https://github.com/MA-FS/MA-FS_Portfolio/blob/main/assets/images/ma-fs_portfolio-complete.png?raw=true)
