      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
            With a background in Electrotechnology and working within the mining industry for over 15 years in 
            the capacity of Electrician, Electrical Supervisor, Instrumentation Technician & DCS Engineer I have 
            always worked closely with process control and logic based systems. By always having an open mind and
            enjoying the process of learning new programming skills and languages it has afforded me the 
            opportunity to work in different capacities along my career path.
        </p>
        <p>
            In parallel to my working life I have always maintained an interest in trading & portfolio management. 
            In 2017 this passion led me to the discovery of the burgeoning industry that is blockchain where I 
            fell deep down the rabbit hole. The implications that blockchain and the Web 3.0 has on our future, 
            along with the problems that it solves is too large to ignore and I felt I needed to be part of that 
            movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future I hope to work on projects that provide useful tools and aid others with similar passions 
            in bolstering their efforts. Please feel free to follow along as I build out this journey.
        </p>
